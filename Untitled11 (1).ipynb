        "1. Overfitting\n",
        "Definition: Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing not only the underlying patterns but also the noise and random fluctuations. As a result, the model performs exceptionally well on the training data but generalizes poorly to unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consequences:\n",
        "\n",
        "High accuracy on training data, but poor performance on test/validation data.\n",
        "Lack of generalization to new data, leading to incorrect predictions when encountering new or slightly different examples.\n",
        "Mitigation strategies:\n",
        "\n",
        "Use more data: Adding more training data can help the model better capture general patterns.\n",
        "Regularization: Techniques like L1 or L2 regularization penalize large coefficients, forcing the model to be simpler.\n",
        "Cross-validation: Helps in selecting a model that generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
        "Pruning (for decision trees): Removes branches that have little importance to reduce complexity.\n",

        "3. Reduce model complexity\n",
        "Use a simpler model (fewer layers or neurons in neural networks, fewer features in decision trees) to avoid overfitting to noise and irrelevant patterns in the training data.\n",
        "4. Pruning\n",
        "In decision trees or similar models, use pruning techniques to remove branches that have little significance, simplifying the model.\n",
        "5. Early stopping\n",
        "During training, monitor the model's performance on a validation set. Stop the training when the performance on the validation data starts to degrade, as further training may lead to overfitting.\n",
        "6. Dropout (for neural networks)\n",
        "Randomly drop neurons during training with a dropout layer, which prevents the network from becoming too reliant on specific neurons and forces it to learn more general patterns.\n",
        "7. Increase training data\n",
        "If possible, add more training data. This helps the model learn more general patterns rather than overfitting to the noise in a small dataset.\n",
        "8. Data augmentation\n",
        "For image or time series data, use data augmentation to artificially increase the size of the training set by creating modified versions of existing data (rotations, flips, scaling, etc.).\n",
        "9. Ensemble methods\n",
