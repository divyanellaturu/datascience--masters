        "Min-Max scaling is a technique used in data preprocessing to rescale features so that they fall within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. This is particularly important when machine learning models are sensitive to the magnitude of data (like in algorithms based on distances such as k-NN, SVM, or neural networks). It ensures that each feature contributes equally to the model's performance, regardless of its original scale.\n",
